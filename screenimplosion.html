          <p class="bold">Website for my independent video games label with two commercially released games on iOS,
            Android and desktop. Also a documentary about independent videogames.</p>

              <span>The Target</span>
              <p>Screen Implosion is a studio for small independent video games for desktop and mainly mobile platforms.
                Under the studio label I could develop some of my personal interests regarding interactive media and
                videogames.
                The aim of these games were to practice programming, launch them on digital stores, send them to events
                and
                be part of an emergent community of independent game developers.</p>

          <span>The Scope</span>
          <p>I started doing small videogames in a tool called Game Maker with a rich API for fast development, mainly
            2D. Then I started learning Unity and some 3D gaming.</p>
          <span>The Engine</span>
          <p>I coded all the games mainly in C# within Unity. I created the 3d models in Cinema 4D and the graphics in
            Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>
          <span>The Process</span>
          <p>This videogames would come up out of game jams, ideas or experiments with technologies.</p>
          <span>Validation</span>
          <p>"Downhill* Chapter One" was selected in many independent videogame festivals worldwide including Tokyo Game
            Show.</p>
          <span>Learnings</span>
          <p>I learnt a lot, not only on the technical side but also on the personal side. It was an enriching
            experience
            full of new connections and friends. A very creative period.</p>
