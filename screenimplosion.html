                            <h3>The Target</h3>
                            <p>Screen Implosion is a studio for small independent video games for desktop and mainly mobile platforms. Under the studio label I could develop some of my personal interests regarding interactive media and videogames. The aim
                                of these games were to practice programming, launch them on digital stores, send them to events and be part of an emergent community of independent game developers.</p>

                    <h3>The Scope</h3>
                    <p>I started doing small videogames in a tool called Game Maker with a rich API for fast development, mainly 2D. Then I started learning Unity and some 3D gaming.</p>
                    <h3>The Engine</h3>
                    <p>I coded all the games mainly in C# within Unity. I created the 3d models in Cinema 4D and the graphics in Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>
                    <h3>The Process</h3>
                    <p>This videogames would come up out of game jams, ideas or experiments with technologies.</p>
                    <h3>Validation</h3>
                    <p>"Downhill* Chapter One" was selected in many independent videogame festivals worldwide including Tokyo Game Show.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <p>I learnt a lot, not only on the technical side but also on the personal side. It was an enriching experience full of new connections and friends. A very creative period.</p>
