              <h3>The Target</h3>
              <p>Screen Implosion is a studio for small independent video games for desktop and mainly mobile platforms.
                Under the studio label I could develop some of my personal interests regarding interactive media and
                videogames.
                The aim of these games were to practice programming, launch them on digital stores, send them to events
                and
                be part of an emergent community of independent game developers.</p>

          <img src="./images/indie_games/webs_min.png" alt="">

          <h3>The Scope</h3>
          <p>I started doing small videogames in a tool called Game Maker with a rich API for fast development, mainly
            2D. Then I started learning Unity and some 3D gaming.</p>
          <h3>The Engine</h3>
          <p>I coded all the games mainly in C# within Unity. I created the 3d models in Cinema 4D and the graphics in
            Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>
          <h3>The Process</h3>
          <p>This videogames would come up out of game jams, ideas or experiments with technologies.</p>
         <h3>Validation</h3>
          <p>"Downhill* Chapter One" was selected in many independent videogame festivals worldwide including Tokyo Game
            Show.</p>
          <h3>Learnings</h3>
          <p>I learnt a lot, not only on the technical side but also on the personal side. It was an enriching
            experience
            full of new connections and friends. A very creative period.</p>

          <div class="flex-column">
            <h3>The Engine</h3>
            <p>Downhill is made in Unity and deployed for Desktop PC, MAC and mobile iOS and Android. It was developed
              with 3D models made in Cinema 4D, sprites made with photoshop, and coded in C#. Plus libraries for ads
              monetization and social networking.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-column">

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Developing a 3D game. Market and publishing it, get it to main independent games development events and
              contests. Have a notorius presence on digital stores. Network and make contacts, promote it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-column">

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>Downhill was slowly made between Berlin, Madrid and Galicia. It takes a lot of references of modern
              sculptures from Sol Lewitt, Constantin Brancusi, Isamu Noguchi. It also wanted to display the vibe of
              japanese graphic designers such Yusaku Kamekura, Shigeo Fukuda, Eizin Suzuki... Some of my personal
              tastes and interests were influential during the conception of the game. </p>
          </div>
        </div>

       <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>After the release, the game was downloaded +60k new users and got modest press worldwide. The most
          satisfying result was the selection from many independent games development events and contest like Tokio
          Game Show, Busan Indie Connect, Genoa Game Happens, Bilbao Az Play, Vienna Radius Festival... </p>

        </div>
        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <p>I learnt a lot about 3D game coding, about marketing, branding, about giving a set of features to my game
          and enjoying the process of conception. I enjoyed a lot the artistic research for this game. The travels I
          got to do during the development, visiting friends and family made this game very pleasant to do. It was
          hard work at some point but very inspiring. The results were surprisingly good and acceptance overall was
          very satisfying. z </p>

        </div> -->

        <div class="project-info">
          <h3>The Target</h3>
          <p>This was my first game made in Unity so lots of back and forth. The game is very independent, out of
            fashion. Inspired in the late 80s shoot em ups but with a spin and new contemporary mechanics regarding
            points, lives and power ups.</p>
          <h3>The Scope</h3>
          <p>This game was aimed to release in forums on desktop and indie games pages but eventually the game got
            releases on iOS and android aswell.</p>
          <h3>The Engine</h3>
          <p>Made in Unity, using libraries just for add ons like ads monetization, social network sharing etc...The
            rest of the application is made without Unity assets for serveral reasons. One is because at the time there
            weren't that many Unity assets with visual effects. The second reason is because the game was for the sake
            of learning coding in C# and get familiar with Unity</p>
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>Finishing this game with all the features to monetise it was a great challenge, publishing in digital
            stores, marketing them, preparing all the assets and communications with press, events etc...was lots of
            work and learning, but also a lot of fun. Creating a pipeline of marketing work for the first time takes
            time. It was very benefitial for my next project.</p>
          <h3>The Process</h3>
          <p>I had made this game in game maker and I used the same idea to learn Unity. This can be downloaded <a
              href="https://volando.itch.io/surfize">on this itch.io page</a></p>
          <p>From this point I started coding it in Unity. Some effects were not accurate regarding the original
            resulting a differnet version.</p>

          </div>
         <h3>Validation</h3>
          <p>The game was showcased in some events with good feedback. Also was mentioned in the specialised press. I
            could take some attention of reputable journalists by finding my unique pitch about it.
          </p>
          <h3>Learnings</h3>
          <p>I learnt Unity and how to implement libraries for monetisation. Also how to publish it in digital stores
            like App Store and Google Play.</p>
