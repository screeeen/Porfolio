                            <h3>The Engine</h3>
                            <p>Downhill is made in Unity and deployed for Desktop PC, MAC and mobile iOS and Android. It was developed with 3D models made in Cinema 4D, sprites made with photoshop, and coded in C#. Plus libraries for ads monetization and
                                social networking.</p>

                            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                            <p>Developing a 3D game. Market and publishing it, get it to main independent games development events and contests. Have a notorius presence on digital stores. Network and make contacts, promote it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="flex-column">

                            <h3>The Process</h3>
                            <p>Downhill was slowly made between Berlin, Madrid and Galicia. It takes a lot of references of modern sculptures from Sol Lewitt, Constantin Brancusi, Isamu Noguchi. It also wanted to display the vibe of japanese graphic designers
                                such Yusaku Kamekura, Shigeo Fukuda, Eizin Suzuki... Some of my personal tastes and interests were influential during the conception of the game. </p>

                    </div>

                    <h3>Validation</h3>
                    <p>After the release, the game was downloaded +60k new users and got modest press worldwide. The most satisfying result was the selection from many independent games development events and contest like Tokio Game Show, Busan Indie Connect,
                        Genoa Game Happens, Bilbao Az Play, Vienna Radius Festival... </p>

                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <p>I learnt a lot about 3D game coding, about marketing, branding, about giving a set of features to my game and enjoying the process of conception. I enjoyed a lot the artistic research for this game. The travels I got to do during the
                        development, visiting friends and family made this game very pleasant to do. It was hard work at some point but very inspiring. The results were surprisingly good and acceptance overall was very satisfying. z </p>
