            <h3>The Target</h3>
            <p>
              Passengers on mid-long haul would avoid the tiresome experience of
              cabin while enjoying movies, 360 movies, vr videogames,
              documentaries, news but also infotainment applications like
              geolocation info interfaces, additional airline resources,
              shopping etc... On the other hand Airlines try to offer new
              inflight entertainment solutions providing a fresh experience to
              their customers and having a platform where feedback and analytics
              can be enriched, thus improving ther customer experience and
              improving their revenue.
            </p>

            <h3>The Scope</h3>
            <p>
              Inflight VR is a start up trying to introduce virtual reality as
              an inflight Entertainment System. With the aim of providing new
              services in the framework of mobility 4.0, connecting further
              digital services, and providing future use cases. It also provides
              a connection between passengers and airlines via data.
            </p>
            <h3>The Engine</h3>
            <p>
              The platform is a complex compound of different software and
              platforms. On the following list I mention the interfaces I
              systems I took care of:
            </p>

                    their content, services and features. They can operate and
                    deploy on VR headsets and explore analytics.

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  Novel technology brings an oportunity to learn. On one side
                  2017 there were still a lot of the questions reagarding XR
                  interfaces. How would the user operate the platform without
                  bringing additional hardware to the aircraft? How could we
                  develop a system where an average of 2k for each eye could be
                  streamed to everyheadset? How could I handle all the
                  restrictions and emergency procedures within virtual reality?
                  How could we minimize the motion sickness? How could the
                  software explain to the user the interface when they never put
                  a headset on? I had endless challenges to sort out, every
                  week.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="flex-column">
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>
                  The more demanding structure and user interface in this
                  project was the virtual reality user interface. To comprehend
                  how this system could be easily understood by users I had to
                  put all our assumptions into a dummy prototype with fake
                  media. After testing and iterations I managed to find a sweet
                  spot between functionality, ergonomics, usability and
                  aesthetics. This prototype became the sandbox environment of
                  many ideas and premises to be tested and the proof of concept
                  for production development.
                </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
              Out of a prototype with heavy complex hardware, a project full of
              uncertainties and a non standard user interface. We managed to
              conceive and optimise a great platform to the most lightweight,
              affordable and frictionless product for non digital users.
            </p>
            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>
              On this project I had the oportunity to learn how to design on
              premises without having a clear framework. It was a great chance
              to apply all the knowledge I had acquired to solve issues without
              a previous defined procedure. Bringing a system where the users
              can satisfy their needs along an unusual environment, comming up
              with novel interfaces and new interactivity designs was a very
              enriching experience.

            <h3>The Target</h3>
            <p>
              Cabin Crew Members with their necessities during flight. The
              application would serve as a monitor and managing tool of the
              headsets.
            </p>
            <h3>The Scope</h3>
            <p>
              A very simple, easy to use and quick operational application.
              Cabin crew members can pair their headset via QR code once the
              headset is delivered to the passenger. Send notifications, set
              states and perform duty free sales.
            </p>
            <h3>The Engine</h3>
            <p>
              The app was designed in Adobe XD and developed in React Native.
              All the endpoints aimed to the platform middleware.

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding the necessities of the cabin crew members.
                  Designing with operations manager a quick way to identify,
                  pair, unpair and track the active headsets on the aircraft. It
                  was also a challenge to design an interface with several
                  dependent states related to security procedures within the
                  aircraft. This application was developed in a month.
                </p>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>
                  A first scribble and wireframe was introduced to the
                  stakeholders so I used Adobe XD for rapid prototyping in order
                  to test and agree on premises. This prototype was easy to
                  handle to developers and founded a design system for further
                  tools. After the first iteration, we could spend more time
                  polishing interaction and functionality.
                </p>
                <h3>Validation</h3>
                <p>
                  The application was deployed on android handsets and tested
                  inflight. After early feedback the system was consolidated and
                  integrated into production platform.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>
              It was my first experience with Adobe XD. Having used Balsamiq for
              most of my previous projects, XD felt very compelling. The idea of
              having the quality design, vector based coexisting with the design
              system was super!
