          <h3>The Target</h3>
          <p>This was my first game made in Unity so lots of back and forth. The game is very independent, out of
            fashion. Inspired in the late 80s shoot em ups but with a spin and new contemporary mechanics regarding
            points, lives and power ups.</p>
          <h3>The Scope</h3>
          <p>This game was aimed to release in forums on desktop and indie games pages but eventually the game got
            releases on iOS and android aswell.</p>
          <h3>The Engine</h3>
          <p>Made in Unity, using libraries just for add ons like ads monetization, social network sharing etc...The
            rest of the application is made without Unity assets for serveral reasons. One is because at the time there
            weren't that many Unity assets with visual effects. The second reason is because the game was for the sake
            of learning coding in C# and get familiar with Unity</p>
          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>Finishing this game with all the features to monetise it was a great challenge, publishing in digital
            stores, marketing them, preparing all the assets and communications with press, events etc...was lots of
            work and learning, but also a lot of fun. Creating a pipeline of marketing work for the first time takes
            time. It was very benefitial for my next project.</p>
          <h3>The Process</h3>
          <p>I had made this game in game maker and I used the same idea to learn Unity. This can be downloaded <a
              href="https://volando.itch.io/surfize">on this itch.io page</a></p>
          <p>From this point I started coding it in Unity. Some effects were not accurate regarding the original
            resulting a differnet version.</p>

          </div>
         <h3>Validation</h3>
          <p>The game was showcased in some events with good feedback. Also was mentioned in the specialised press. I
            could take some attention of reputable journalists by finding my unique pitch about it.
          </p>
          <h3>Learnings</h3>
          <p>I learnt Unity and how to implement libraries for monetisation. Also how to publish it in digital stores
            like App Store and Google Play.</p>
