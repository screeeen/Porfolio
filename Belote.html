              User Experience Design for the classic french card game on a
              digital multiplatform game (Facebook, Web, native mobile) made at
              Game Duell GmbH
            </p>
            <img src="./images/interaction_images/Belote.png" alt="" />
            <h3>The Target</h3>
            <p>
              Gameduell.com has a solid and profitable platform of diverse web
              games with a stable userbase and good knowledge of marketing
              practices. In 2012 after the social games boom they decided to
              port most of their popular games to social networks like Facebook.
              They also strategically planned how to develop several clients of
              the same game in different platforms.
            </p>
            <h3>The Scope</h3>
            <p>
              I took over two games: A facebook shooter called Bubble Speed,
              with daily rankings and a userbase of 150k daily users. My duties
              were designing, leading the production and testing features that
              could improve engage and retention metrics. I also was in charge
              of the port of Belote / Coinche digital card games to ios. From
              the initial business requirements We broke down the roadmap
              features and I was in charge of designing the UI, map controls,
              adapt the experience to the handset and tablet devices.
            </p>
            <h3>The Engine</h3>
            <p>
              We used the ios native technology to implemente this client
              application. Swift wasn't released yet, so the implementation was
              made in Objective C#
            </p>

              alt=""
            />
            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Designing a layout for tablet, then mobile phone. Setting up all
              the game and UI elements. Designing features that could be
              functional cross platform.
            </p>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>
              After the required pen and paper blueprints. I used mainly
              Balsamiq to produce interactive mockups in pdf so we could test
              them internally and validate some user flows. Once the wireframes
              were ready to go, a team of artists started with ilustrations of
              characters, UI elements, cards, marketing materials etc... It took
              about 5 to 6 months to get an mvp that could be deployed live.
              Animations and quality details were fundamental to stand out in
              the app store.
            </p>
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
              After the mvp and with the grow of tablet and smartphone users we
              could see a raise of converted users from other platforms and also
              an incremental number of new users every month.
            </p>
            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>
              I learnt about project kick off, backlog set up, Jira and
              Confluence documentations, producing interactive mock ups back in
              the days in Balsamiq. I explored a lot about layouts for mobile
              devices, cross platform applications with user accounts, UI/UX for
              mobile and also I developed great skills playing Belote and
              Coinche!
