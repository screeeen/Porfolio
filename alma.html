            <h3>The Target</h3>
            <p>
              Alma 2D Viewer is a portable, device-agnostic medical imaging
              application that offers healthcare professionals advanced tools
              for visualizing and analyzing radiological studies. It ensures a
              secure, non-traceable environment for handling medical images.
            </p>

            <h3>The Scope</h3>
            <p>
              Alma 2D Viewer is part of Alma Medical's proprietary ecosystem of
              radiology imaging solutions. My role centered on developing the
              frontend interface, enabling an effective visualisation,
              interaction and communication with diverse PACS (Picture Archiving
              and Communication Systems).
            </p>
            <h3>The Engine</h3>
            <p>
              The platform employs a robust web technology stack: React on the
              client side, integrating open source OHIF (Open Health Imaging
              Foundation) viewer modules to support DICOMWeb standards (WADO-RS,
              QIDO-RS, STOW-RS) and traditional DICOM formats using
              cornerstone.js, adapting dicom-parser and custom-built code
              tailored to client needs. Key Contributions:

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
              Adapting the OHIF viewer to meet diverse client requirements posed
              significant challenges, particularly in tailoring workflows to
              specific use cases. This involved extending and modifying existing
              tools, implementing custom features such as synched viewports,
              multi-image visualizations or ECG (Electro Cardio Graph).
              Integrating proprietary 3D software for MPR (Multi-Plane
              Reconstruction) and volumetric views required attention to detail
              to ensure interoperability with the 2D viewer and backend systems.
              Another challenges were gaining a deep understanding of the DICOM
              standard, including parsing its extensive metadata and handling
              the nuances of medical imaging protocols. Balancing performance,
              compliance with medical data regulations, and accessibility added
              further complexity to the project.
            </p>

            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>
              The development involved iterative prototyping and close
              collaboration with stakeholders, including radiologists and UX
              designers, to refine workflows and ensure an intuitive user
              experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
              Deployed across various clinics and widely used by radiologists,
              Alma 2D Viewer became a cornerstone product in the companyâ€™s
              portfolio. It delivers a portable, non-traceable solution for
              rapid diagnostics, supporting a range of devices including
              desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

            <h3>Learnings</h3>
            <p>
              This project allowed me to deepen my expertise in frontend
              development for high-stakes environments. I gained experience in
              optimizing complex visual rendering pipelines, designing
              interfaces that align with user needs, and ensuring compliance
              with industry regulations. It was an enriching opportunity to
              contribute to a product that directly impacts patient care and
              medical outcomes.
